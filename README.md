Got it — the earlier VS Code steps I gave you were more step-by-step and beginner-friendly.
Let’s rewrite the README so that **VS Code setup** is as clear as Eclipse.

Here’s the **improved README** with **detailed VS Code instructions**:

If you want, I can **add MySQL table creation instructions** so even someone with no DB setup can follow it without asking you.  
That will make the README look professional.  

Do you want me to include that?
